## Asylum App Generator

So, we didn't get as far as we'd like code wise, but we were able to define our concept and determine one major problem with the current matching system.

Our concept was to optimize the form application process by making a wizard type style form. By completing in this manner, the entire application is less overwhelming. We also thought about having an initial screening form that asks the applicant if they would like more resources or would like someone to reach out to them to help them complete the application (ie. if they did not speak english).

The major problem/gap we identified was the lack of cohesion in country data. Information about what countries can support, what types of programs they offer, etc, is very scattered throughout the web. We thought it would be incredibly beneficial to first start aggregating this data into an open source database/api so that companies like humanwire could benefit from a centralized source to match applicants against.

Our app seeks to simplify the form process and then match applicants to countries based on the priority level of certain fields on the country database schema.
